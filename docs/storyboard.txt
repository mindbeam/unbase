State IS ephemeral!
Edits are for keeps ( actually policy AND probability-based retention )


****Takedown page - why everything sucks.****
 * CAP
 * Eventual Consistency
...

Big problem common to most of these? All of you data has to have a home.
When data has a home, chances are we have to travel there.

***** the UNBASE Saga ****

Explain that we're talking about a simplified model in the form of a kv store.

** Consistency Model:

(Start with Alice)
Immutable data
Immutable data edit
causal reference ( applied to above )
surprise, this is not state, these are operations ( introduce Memos )
non-concurrent projection of state ( what is it, lets go through an exercise )
concurrency ( introduce Bob )
concurrent projection
infectious knowledge and then projection


*** Ok, great, now how the fuck do we make that actually work?
Why do we care? What have we gained?

Now, some problems. No free lunch
context expansion
write amplification
sparse vector clocks


*** implementation clarification ( What did we win? )

Introduce: Model or Subject or Topic ( this is a design goal )
Why do I need a consistency model for my index.
To make the system scalable I need to be able to spread my data around without a priori planning ( also a design goal )
BUUTTT I also need to be able to find it!


( my data doesn't actually exist anywhere, by my edits are all over the place! )
